            <p>
                We're the Robosub team for the University of California, San
                Diego. We're a diverse family, with interests in computer
                science, engineering, and more -- including a passion to create
                an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our members seek to
                strengthen their skills in computer vision, engineering
                fundamentals, and most importantly, teamwork!
